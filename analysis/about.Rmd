# The Muyumoqo Archaeological Project

## Project Overview

**Muyumoqo** is an archaeological excavation project focused on analyzing lithic (stone tool) assemblages and obsidian artifacts. This research helps us understand:

- How ancient peoples used and manufactured tools
- Settlement patterns and site use over time
- Trade networks through obsidian sourcing
- Cultural practices through tool types and distributions

## The Data

### What We Collected

Our excavation generated data in several forms:

1. **Lithic Analysis Data** - Detailed measurements and classifications of stone tools
2. **Obsidian Data** - Specific information about obsidian artifacts from excavation units
3. **Contextual Information** - Where artifacts were found, at what depth, in which excavation units

### Data Files

- `lithic_analysis(analysis).csv` - Stone tool measurements and attributes
- `obsidian_data_26(UNITS 8A 8B).csv` - Obsidian artifacts from Units 8A and 8B
- `2023_muyumoqo fichas - UE5.csv` - Field documentation from Unit 5

## How to Use This Site

### For Learning Data Analysis

If you're new to data analysis, we recommend:

1. Start with the **Home** page for an overview
2. Read the **Data Overview** section to understand what information we have
3. Follow the analyses in order - each builds on previous concepts
4. Read the explanations carefully - code is explained in plain language

### For Understanding the Methods

Each analysis page includes:

- **The Question** - What are we trying to learn?
- **The Method** - How do we analyze the data?
- **The Code** - The actual R code (don't worry if it looks intimidating!)
- **The Results** - What did we discover?

### For Reproducing This Work

All code and data are available here. You can:

- Download the data files
- Run the analyses yourself in R
- Modify the code to ask new questions
- Learn by experimenting!

## Technologies Used

This project uses:

- **R** - A statistical programming language (free and open-source)
- **workflowr** - A tool that organizes research projects for reproducibility
- **renv** - Manages R package dependencies to ensure reproducibility
- **RMarkdown** - Combines text explanations with executable R code

No special tools needed to read this site - just a web browser!

## About Reproducibility

A key principle of this project is **reproducibility**: anyone with the same data should be able to recreate these results exactly. We use `renv` to track package versions and `workflowr` to document the process clearly.

## Getting Started with R (For Beginners)

If you want to run this analysis yourself:

### Step 1: Install R and RStudio
- Download R from https://www.r-project.org/
- Download RStudio (the free version) from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

### Step 2: Clone or Download This Project
Download the entire project folder to your computer.

### Step 3: Open the Project
Open `Archaeology.Rproj` in RStudio. This sets up your working environment.

### Step 4: Restore the Packages
In the RStudio console, type:
```r
renv::restore()
```
This installs all the R packages needed, with the exact versions we used.

### Step 5: Open the Analysis Files
In the `analysis/` folder, open any `.Rmd` file and click "Knit" to run the analysis!

## Questions or Feedback?

This is a learning project! If something is unclear, that's valuable feedback. Consider opening an issue or contacting the project maintainers.
